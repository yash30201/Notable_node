# Middleware
+ Its a piece of code having access to req and res and runs before a request is processed and after the response is created.
+ For example - 
```
app.use('/', function(req, res, next){
  //do something here
  next(); // goes to next middleware in the stack
  or 
  next('route') // goes to the next defined route
})
```
+ **!!!** If next(), is not written in middleware it will stop there and will not even execute the get request!
---
+ **Itâ€™s important to note that middleware tools are executed according to the order in which you define them.**
